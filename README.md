# Data Management for Natural Scientists
a guide to keep UMBS researchers and students organized throughout the data lifecycle

   
### Why to manage your data:
- Your research is most credible when backed by data that is reproducable and reusable.
- You save yourself and other scientists money and resources by keeping your data organized and accessible.
- Your professor or sponsor will potentially require it.

- *If you give your data to a colleague outside of your project, will they be able to make sense of it? Will they be able to use it effectively and properly?*
