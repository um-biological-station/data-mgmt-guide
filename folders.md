# Keeping your files organized

Included in this repository are a [set of empty folders](https://github.com/um-biological-station/data-mgmt-guide) that can be used to structure your master project folder. You can download them or just use them as a guide to organize all the files involved in your project. *Keep in mind that the descriptions of folder content below are just suggestions. The files required for your project are dependent on your organization, funding, field of study, personal preference, etc.*

Here's an overview of the provided folders:
   - **home**: contains *all* of your project files (rename with a short but useful name for your project)
      - **docs**: project planning, project proposal, team and grant info, versioning info
      - **metadata**: metadata template, files required for your chosen metadata format, experimental methods, descriptive notes on how data was cleaned (this can also be achieved with code)
      - **code**: code used for cleaning data (R notebooks are a good choice), code used to general models, code used to compile a metadata file
      - **output**: final dataset, final files for publishing/sharing, README for data users, final/compiled metadata file
      - **raw**: raw data collected in the field, pictures of field notes or drawings, files containing data as it is initially recorded (usually Excel or plain text)
      - any files that give guidance for your team or require quick/frequent access can live right in your home folder (i.e. team README, team contact info, quick links)
*These descriptions can also be found in info.txt files located in the sample folders provided.*   

The goal is for your file organization to speak for itself. Choose a folder layout that is clear and appropriate for your project. Consult your team, a mentor, or a colleague if you're unsure.
