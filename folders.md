# Keeping your files organized

Included in this repository are a set of empty folders that can be used to structure your project folder. You can download them or just use them as a guide to organize all the files involved in your project.
Here's an overview:
   - main (rename with a short but useful name for your project)
      - docs - planning, proposal, team info, versioning if necessary
      - metadata - template, files required for whatever metadata format you're using, methods docs, good notes on how data was cleaning (if not clear from code)
      - code - code used for cleaning data (R notebook, etc), code used to general models, code used to compile metadata files
      - output - final dataset and files to publish/share, README for data users if needed, final metadata files maybe
      - raw - raw data collected in the field, pictures of field notes or drawings, excel files containing data as it is initially recorded
      - any files that give guidance for your team i.e. README
